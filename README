To run this, simply run the ui_main.py

all of the predator prey mathematical code is in predatorprey.py

an example of the code working without the GUI is simpleplot.py

The __main__ in predatorprey.py can be run by anyone with python3.2

simpleplot.py can be run if you have matplotlib (pylab)

This should be able to be run on the linux lab. Otherwise, it requires
PyQt4 and matplotlib (pylab).

It's not worth installing those to run on a windows machine.
